# gICCa (IRC mailing CLI application)


This is a CLI app which uses the IRCCloud client.
Currently, the app is able to login a user and save the login credentials for future logins, send and messages to a particular messages to particular nick.

To use the app, enter the following commands

`git clone https://github.com/akshayaky/gICCa/`

`cd gICCa`

`go build main.go`

`./main`

In its current state the app has a lot of issues, I plan to solve them as I develop the app.

For the UI, I used gocui package by jroimartin, check out his repository here [https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)
